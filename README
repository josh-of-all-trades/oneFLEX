The oneFLEX is a gesture recoginizing wrist accessory for iPhones.  It works by recording certain gestures (via gyroscope and flex sensors) and the phone receives these signals to react (ie changing songs or flipping through content of a website).  The oneFLEX was an original idea by Josh Rojas and improved by the creative visions of Noah Shutty and Alex Day. The oneFLEX was created at the Seattle Wearables hackathon 07/12/14 - 07/13/14.
